Statistics
**********

OiRA contains the capability of generating usage statistics reports. In
addition to a global overview there are reports on the country level as well as
for individual tools.

The admin interface has a page that allows entering report parameters that are
then sent to Tomcat. The `report templates`_ are implemented using the Eclipse
`BIRT`_ platform. The reports are generated by Tomcat using the data in the SQL
database. The resulting report can be directly downloaded by the user.

The statistics feature uses a number of database tables in addition to the ones
defined in the online client's :ref:`schema_structure`:

.. graphviz:: statistics.dot

.. _report templates: https://github.com/EU-OSHA/oira.reports
.. _BIRT: http://www.eclipse.org/birt/
